### Hi there 👋

- 🔭  I’m currently working at [Arthur](https://askarthur.art/)! An art-tech startup trying to democratize information about the Art world.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
- :exclamation: I've built [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/Mgancita/cookiecutter-pypackage). A cookiecutter for production Python packages with free CI/CD via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), packaging via [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and publishing to PyPI!
- 💬  Ask me about Docker, FastAPI, GitHub Actions, GCP, and CI/CD!
- 📫  How to reach me: marco.gancitano97@gmail.com
- ⚡  Fun fact: I like reading books about Psychology
